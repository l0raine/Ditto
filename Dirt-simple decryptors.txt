####### ASM CODE
; start is the addr of the first dword to decrypt
; end is the addr just after the last dword to decrypt
; key is a random immediate nonzero DWORD for decryption

####### Simple decryptor, easy to analyze, not too suspicious.
It clearly does what it says on the tin, no tricks or weird behavior. 
Only data is manipulated (xor), so hopefully this isn't too suspicious.

######### Decryptor using stack manipulation to ret first to the decryptor, then the old entry point
The idea is to trick analysis into thinking the ret is safe and used to go to the decryptor. 
But it's also used to jump to the old EP, whose address is obfuscated. This way static analysis is in trouble to find the real entry point.
On the other end, this code is probably more suspicious.
Let's say the old EP you want to go to is 00401570, and XXXX is a random value, replace the old EP at bytes 3 and 37
